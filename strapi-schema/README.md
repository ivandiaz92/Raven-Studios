# Strapi content-type schemas

These JSON files define the **Portfolio** and **Blog Post** collection types that the Next.js app expects.

- Use them as reference when creating content types in the Strapi Content-Type Builder, or  
- Copy them into your Strapi project (see **STRAPI_SETUP.md** → Option B).

API endpoints used by the app: `/api/portfolios`, `/api/blog-posts`.
