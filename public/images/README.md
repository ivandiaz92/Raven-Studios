# Images

Place your **logo** here so the site can use it in the header.

- **Logo (AVIF):** Use the file `raven-logo.avif` in this folder.  
  The header uses it automatically. If the file is missing, the text “RAVEN” is shown instead.  
  (Use a name without spaces to avoid 404s.)

Path: **`public/images/raven-logo.avif`** → URL: `/images/raven-logo.avif`
